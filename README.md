# Telegram RAG Bot

This Telegram RAG Bot allows anyone to create a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) call through a Telegram bot. The bot interacts with OpenAI’s API to generate responses based on user input combined with custom data sources. This README provides all the necessary instructions to set up and run the bot.

## Overview

This project provides a Python script that runs a server for your Telegram bot. After setting up your OpenAI API key and Telegram bot credentials, you can interact with your RAG file directly via Telegram. The bot processes incoming messages, performs a RAG call, and responds accordingly.

---

## Features

- **RAG Call**: Integrates retrieval-augmented generation to create dynamic responses.
- **Telegram Integration**: Seamless connection with Telegram’s Bot API.
- **Easy Configuration**: Just update the configuration file with your API keys and credentials.
- **Server-Ready**: Run the server locally or on a remote machine to start chatting instantly.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**  
- Required Python packages (install via pip):
  - `python-telegram-bot`
  - `openai`
  - `Flask` or any other server framework (if needed for your implementation)
  - Other dependencies as specified in your `requirements.txt`

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram-rag-bot.git
   cd telegram-rag-bot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Configuration

Before running the server, you need to set up your API credentials:

1. **OpenAI API Key**:  
   - Sign up at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) if you haven't already.
   - Obtain your API key and insert it into the script or configuration file.

2. **Telegram Bot Credentials**:  
   - Create a Telegram bot by talking to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
   - Obtain your bot token.
   - Insert the bot token into the script or configuration file.

> **Note:** Ensure you do not expose your API keys and credentials in public repositories.

---

## Usage

1. **Run the Server**  
   Start the Python server script:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
   The server will start and listen for incoming messages from Telegram.

2. **Interact on Telegram**  
   - Open Telegram and search for your bot by its username.
   - Start a conversation and begin chatting. The bot will process your messages using RAG and respond accordingly.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot Not Responding**:  
  - Verify that the server is running without errors.
  - Check that your Telegram bot token and OpenAI API key are correctly configured.
  - Ensure your server is accessible (e.g., no firewall blocking incoming connections).

- **API Errors**:  
  - Check your API usage limits on OpenAI.
  - Validate that the input data and configuration are set up as per the script's requirements.

- **Debugging**:  
  - Use logging to capture server output and error messages.
  - Review the console logs for any traceback or error messages that can help pinpoint the issue.
